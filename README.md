# StackConceptAndPractice
 This repo includes important knowledge of Stack.
 
 The postfix.c program only performs postfix evaluation. The postfix2.c, in addition to performing postfix evaluation, also includes the functionality to read the postfix expression. The in2post3 program converts an infix expression to a postfix expression and then performs postfix evaluation.
 
 As for the Stack.c program demonstrates how to implement a basic stack operation using a stack data structure. Users can push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, and output the contents of the stack.
